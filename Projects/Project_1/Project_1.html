    <h2>Critiques - Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What was your first impression of this site?</li>
            <li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
                on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
            <li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
            <li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
                it? Why?</li>
            <li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
                reasonable?</li>
            <li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
                image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li>
            <li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
                navigation well done?</li>
            <li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
                the pages?</li>
            <li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li>
            <li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>My first impression of this site was that it was very simple and clean. I love the
                 rustic colors simple layout.</li>
            <li>The site uses a banner that drops down on the left side of the site.
                They have simeple pictures and easy descriptions of what the links do.</li>
            <li>The structure of the site is simple. There is a heading at the top of the page and the content below it matches.</li>
            <li>The graphics and layout are clean and simple. They add to the feeling that the site gets
                its food from a local farmer.</li>
            <li>The load time were less than second. Very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I found that the text color, size and background color matched eachother and added to the
                feel of the site. Like a if was getting produce from a farmers stand in the market.</li>
            <li>The site did have a navigation bar. I found it to be strightforward and wasy to understand and use.</li>
            <li>There was a simple and effective theme throughout the site. I found it quite pleasing.</li>
            <li>As the window shrinks, the site acted accordingly and sized apporiately throughout all sizes I tesetd.</li>
            <li>I loved the themed offshoots of the site. For example the "recipes" section is themed after cookware and ingredients all over the page, while the products page is about where the products come from in the same artstyle as the rest of the site.</li>
